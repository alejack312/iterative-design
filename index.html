            For this project, our group was matched with Uno Health, a startup that aims to increase access to Medicare by increasing the ease with which people can apply for Medicare savings.
            Currently, this is a platform that targets a specific user base of people that are eligible for Medicare benefits, but are also technically literate enough to create an account and upload all of the necessary legal documents. However,
            through user research, Uno has found that there is a large population of people that they could access if they allowed someone who is more comfortable with technology to upload the necessary documents on someone else's behalf. We were tasked with
            designing a mobile interface to help reach this exact population. After reading a project brief, we engaged in the design process to add caregiver intervention into the member's standard flow, allowing a caregiver to create an account and, given proper consent, complete the application for someone else (who we refer to as the caree).
            Over the course of sketches, low fidelity wireframes, and eventually a high fidelity Figma protoype, we iterated on this design, incorporating feedback from classmates, our professors, and Elise Livingston, a designer at Uno Health, in order to create a final product that we believe is a strong solution to the problem at hand. After developing our prototype,
            we shared Loom walkthroughs with Elise and conducted a meeting where she gave us feedback that may inform future iterations of our design.

          <p class="inner-text">
            We started by reading our project brief to identify key problems that we were looking to solve. Namely, we tackled the task through two routes. First, we aimed to add a caregiver entry point to allow caregivers to check their caree's eligibility for Medicare benefits. Second, we wanted to add a caregiver account to the member portal that would connect the caree and caregiver and allow for communication
            between the two of them to mutually work together to complete the application for Medicare benefits. In going through the brief, we marked up a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pFMWn-4u-cRtbT4Dtp3y2Np-15KVWit1xV2-Rc7jw2g/edit">working copy</a> to centralize our thoughts and distilled important questions into our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/17I6VJoiBmrdc7xXFZwONhK4MX_UU7SfcpDEf59pdl8c/edit?usp=sharing">public copy</a> 
            for Elise to address. After receiving feedback and clarifying our task, we began our design process by creating sketches

          <p class="inner-text">
            To begin the design process, each of our group members completed two different end to end sketches of the user flow. This provided a starting point to brainstorm ideas for how we might solve the problem at hand. 
            Specifically, this informed our decision to create a separate member portal for caregivers. We also workshopped ideas for how we can best ensure proper consent from the caree yet still offer a lot of control to the caregiver.
            Finally, we thought about the best ways that we can offer safety nets in the case that caregivers or carees may not have access to the documents they need or are unsure of how to get. We then united key findings from our sketches into a low fidelity wireframe.

            After revising our low-fidelity wireframes, we began to create a high-fidelity prototype.
            Using the brand kit provided to us and the feedback from Professor Cho and our peers, 
            we created a style guide to ensure that our design was consistent.

            We used Figma to create high-fidelity versions of the two 'Check Eligibility' flowsâ€”caregiver and caree.
            Furthermore, we created various high-fidelity versions of the member portals. These included various states
            the user could find the portal in, such as the caregiver portal with a caree already connected, 
            the caregiver portal with no caree connected, and the caree portal with a caregiver connected, etc. 
            We linked these pages together to create a clickable prototype that we could share with Elise.

            <!-- TODO: Discussion of design choices (See handout) -->
            To dive more in-depth, we made a few key design choices that we 
            believe will help the user navigate the portal with ease. First, we 
            made deliberate uses of the colors in the brand kit to create a consistent,
            visually appealing, yet accessible design. The colors in the eligibility
            flow come from the brand kit. For the portals, we added some colors
            to distinguish between the caregiver and caree portals, and their 
            different states.  
            
            Furthermore, we added dropdown menus responsible for changing the 
            language and font size if the user needs it. We also added a 
            'Read Aloud' button that would read elements on the page aloud
            for users who may need it.
            
            All buttons were set to follow the same style. Prior, some buttons were 
            more rounded than others. We decided to make all buttons the same shape
            to create a consistent design.
            
            In various frames of the design, we gave users the ability to skip 
            steps if they so choose. This is especially important for users who
            find themselves not having the information they need on hand.

            During our meeting with Elise, we received feedback and briefly went
            over our design process, high-fidelity wireframes, and the key decisions
            we made. Elise provided feedback on the designâ€”specifically that it 
            would be best if we provided with users with a 'best path'. Ways to
            nudge the user towards a decision, particularly, one we are interested
            in them making. This could be accomplished by making some buttons/text 
            larger or more prominent than others. Additionally, she suggested that

          <p class="inner-text">
            Over the course of this project, we were able to transform a project
            brief on a real problem that Uno Health is facing into a high-fidelity 
            clickable prototype that offers a solution to the problem. 

            Stepping through the entire design process from end-to-end, we gained 
            first hand experience iterating on a design and incorporating actionable 
            feedback from our peers and startup partner. In a future design sprint,
            we'd like to keep building out our prototype to include animations that 
            guide users seamlessly through the flow. Further, we'd love to test 
            our prototype on end users to figure out where assumptions we made 
            may have fallen short.

            Finally, keeping the caregiver stakeholder at the top of our minds, 
            we'd imagine what the portal may look like after the point of application. 
            How might caregivers continue to provide help to their carees 
            throughout their time on Uno Health? Exploring this route would 
            allow us to continue realizing Uno's mission of lowering the barrier 
            of entry to Medicare benefits for all those who are eligible.
