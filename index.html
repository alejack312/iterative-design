            Part 1: Introduction
          </h2>
          <p class="inner-text">
            For this project, our group was matched with Uno Health, a startup that aims to improve access to Medicare by increasing the ease with which people can apply for Medicare savings.
            Currently, this is a platform that targets a specific user base of people that are eligible for Medicare benefits, but are also technically literate enough to create an account and upload all of the necessary legal documents. However,
            through user research, Uno has found that there is a large population of people that they could reach if they allowed someone who is more comfortable with technology to upload the necessary documents on someone else's behalf. We were tasked with
            designing a mobile interface to help reach this exact population. After reading a project brief, we engaged in the design process to add caregiver intervention into the member's standard flow, allowing a caregiver to create an account and, given proper consent, complete the application for someone else (who we refer to as the caree).
            Over the course of sketches, low fidelity wireframes, and eventually a high fidelity Figma prototype, we iterated on this design, incorporating feedback from classmates, our professors, and Elise Livingston, a designer at Uno Health, in order to create a final product that we believe is a strong solution to the problem at hand. After developing our prototype,
            we shared Loom walkthroughs with Elise and conducted a meeting where she gave us feedback that may inform future iterations of our design.

          <h2 class="subheading">Part 2: Project Brief</h2>
          <p class="inner-text">
            We started by reading our project brief to identify key problems that we were looking to solve. Namely, we tackled the task through two routes. First, we aimed to add a caregiver entry point to allow caregivers to check their caree's eligibility for Medicare benefits. Second, we wanted to add a caregiver account to the member portal that would connect the caree and caregiver and allow for communication
            between the two of them to mutually work together to complete the application for Medicare benefits. In going through the brief, we marked up a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pFMWn-4u-cRtbT4Dtp3y2Np-15KVWit1xV2-Rc7jw2g/edit">working copy</a> to centralize our thoughts and distilled important questions into our <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/17I6VJoiBmrdc7xXFZwONhK4MX_UU7SfcpDEf59pdl8c/edit?usp=sharing">public copy</a> 
            for Elise to address. After receiving feedback and clarifying our task, we began our design process by creating sketches.

          <h2 class="subheading">Part 3: Sketches</h2>
          <p class="inner-text">
            To begin the design process, each of our group members completed two different end to end sketches of the user flow. This provided a starting point to brainstorm ideas for how we might solve the problem at hand. 
            Specifically, this informed our decision to create a separate member portal for caregivers. We also workshopped ideas for how we can best ensure proper consent from the caree yet still offer a lot of control to the caregiver.
            Finally, we thought about the best ways that we can offer safety nets in the case that caregivers or carees may not have access to the documents they need or are unsure of how to get. We then united key findings from our sketches into a low fidelity wireframe.

          <h3>Design Discussions</h3>
          <p class="inner-text">Our group had a discussion after coming together with our individual wireframes, and decided to include the following elements:</p>
          <ol class="list-style-1">
            <li><b>The creation of a separate 'Caregiver' account.</b> While the prompt could have been interpreted in different ways (i.e. allowing the caregiver to simply share the user's account), all of us went down the route of having the caregiver create a separate account that could be linked with their caree's. We used this in our final design since it was the most intuitive solution to us for our prompt.</li>

            <li><b>Decision point after signup for the user to choose their path as either a member or caregiver.</b> We included this element because it was something that all of us had in our sketches, and it helped create a natural path for a caregiver to sign up for an Uno account.
            </li>

            <li><b>Ability to add a caregiver/caree at different points in the user's journey.</b> Combining our different approaches, we gave the users multiple paths for adding a caregiver/caree. They could either do it at the point of registration for an Uno account, or after they had registered. We also gave the user the ability to remove an existing caregiver/caree, and add a new one.</li>

            <li><b>Emphasis on user consent.</b> Our designs all required the consent of the caree before the caregiver could link their accounts, and vice versa. It was important to us that we incorporated this into our final designs because our app deals with extremely sensitive and identifiable personal data. </li>

            <li><b>Connection between eligibility flow and member portal.</b> From Joe's design, we kept the explicit connection between the eligibility flow and the member portal, such that the user can seamlessly register for an Uno account after determining their eligibility for the different medicare programs. </li>

            <li><b>Ability to manage caregiver/caree connection on the user's home page.</b> From Alejandro, Joe and Zyn's sketches, we kept the ability for a user (either a member or a caregiver) to manage their caregiver/caree connection on the homepage. This is done through the inclusion of buttons that allow users to 'add a caree', 'resend invitation' for example.</li>

            <li><b>Caregiver homepage which provided an overview of their caree's Uno status.</b> All of our sketches included some way for the caregiver to 1. get an overview of their caree's Uno status, and 2. complete Uno tasks on their behalf.</li>

            <li><b>Ability for caregiver/caree to seek help from the other with tasks.</b> From Joe's, Josh's and Zyn's designs, we included an element which allows the caregiver/caree to communicate and ask one another for help with the completion of tasks (i.e. uploading documents).</li>

            <li><b>Helpful buttons if the user is confused about document upload.</b> From Josh's, Joe's and Zyn's designs, we kept informative elements that guided the users if they needed assistance with the process of uploading documents. For instance, we included an element that taught users how to apply for a driver's license if they lost theirs, as well as an example document for reference.</li>

          </ol>

          <h3>Towards our intended impact</h3>
            <p class="inner-text">Our prompt was to make it possible for a caregiver of a member to initiate the enrollment process with Uno Health, and for a member to invite a caregiver to support them during the enrollment process. We have summarized the impact we sought to make and the design we included towards that end below:
              <ol class="list-style-1">
                <li><b>Providing caregivers with ways to help their caree in the Uno process.</b> In our final design, we did this by creating a separate Uno account for caregivers, which could be connected with member (caree) accounts</li>
                <li><b>Enabling caregivers to help their carees through the Uno process even if they are not physically with them.</b> Our final design allows caregivers to upload documents on behalf of their carees, and for the two users to 'communicate' through in app notifications</li>
                <li><b>Providing caregivers with a way to help their carees complete their Uno application, even if they do not have all the related documentation.</b> Our final design includes guidance to caregivers on how to help their carees apply for missing documents at the relevant official government websites.</li>
                <li><b>Involving caregivers in a way that still keeps the member and their data safe.</b> Our final design is conscious of the data privacy of our members, and mandates user consent before any data is shared between members (carees) and their caregivers. Consent is obtained through the following methods: accounts are linked only if the member accepts the caregiver's invite on their account / members are asked to provide consent through phone or text confimation.</li> 
                <li><b>Enabling caregivers to help their careers through the Uno process even if the caree is not comfortable navigating technical systems.</b> Our final design accounted for this impact in later iterations through the inclusion of a caregiver account which did not require their caree to have an existing member account / create a new member account.</li>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="inner-text">Here is a link to our first iteration of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/aMHx2LP2RbsXxn48Py9IKt/Uno-Health-Overview-(Working)?type=design&node-id=2038-415&mode=design">low-fidelity wireframes</a> based on the above design considerations.</p>

          <h3>Low-Fi Wireframe Design Revisions</h3>

          <p class="inner-text">After showing our first iteration of low-fidelity wireframes to our crit section, Professor Vanessa and Elise, we received the following feedback: </p>
          
          <p class="inner-text"><b>Feedback from Crit Section</b></p>
          <ol class="list-style-1">
            <li>Have larger font sizes.</li>
            <li>Ensure consistency in Interaction Elements (i.e. placing the ‘back’ button at the same location of the screen).</li>
            <li>Create a larger ‘login’ button.</li>
            <li>Include more accessibility features.</li>
            <li>Add a Completed’ screen that affirms the user that an action has been successful.</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="inner-text"><b>Feedback from Professor Vanessa</b></p>
          <ol class="list-style-1">
            <li>Personalize the experience by using first names instead of ‘Your Caree’.</li>
            <li>Add descriptive sentences for each title so the experience is friendlier for the user.</li>
            <li>Add a Progress Bar.</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="inner-text"><b>Feedback from Elise (Uno Health)</b></p>
          <ol class="list-style-1">
            <li>Add a screen showing how the caregiver portal will reflect that the caree has requested a specific document from them.</li>
            <li>Connect the caregiver-focused eligibility flow into the caregiver portal flow.</li>
            <li>Create a way for the experience to work in the event that the Caree is not tech savvy at all and might not be willing to create an account or may require a much lighter weight way of interacting with this process.</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="inner-text">Given the feedback we received, we updated our low-fidelity wireframe to include all the suggested changes. Here is the link to our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/aMHx2LP2RbsXxn48Py9IKt/Uno-Health-Overview-(Working)?type=design&node-id=2095-254&mode=design">revised low-fidelity wireframes</a>.</p>

          <p class="inner-text">We included all suggestions in our updated low-fidelity wireframe. A key thing we focused on in this revision was increasing accessibility, since the demographic of Uno health's users skews towards the elderly. Apart from ensuring that we did not go below a font size of 12px on the screens, we also created a scrollbar for users to select text size when using the app. Most of the suggestions were straightforward, and required a minor change. However, we needed to brainstorm how to best incorporate Elise's feedback about creating "a way for the experience to work in the event that the Caree is not tech savvy at all and might not be willing to create an account or may require a much lighter weight way of interacting with this process". In the end, we decided to include a new flow which did not require the caree to create an account at all. The caregiver would be able to help the caree through the Uno application process without having to link their account to their caree's. All we needed was consent from the caree that the caregiver would apply for Uno on their behalf, and the caregiver would have full control over the caree's Uno enrollment and application process.

          <p class="inner-text">
            After revising our low-fidelity wireframes, we began to create a high-fidelity prototype guided by the feedback we received.

            We used Figma to create high-fidelity versions of the two 'Check Eligibility' flows—caregiver and caree.
            Furthermore, we created various high-fidelity versions of the member portals. These included various states
            the user could find the portal in, such as the caregiver portal with a caree already connected, 
            the caregiver portal with no caree connected, and the caree portal with a caregiver connected, etc. 
            We linked these pages together to create a clickable prototype that we could share with Elise.

            <p class="inner-text">
            To dive more in-depth, we made a few key design choices that we 
            believe will help the user navigate the portal with ease. First, we 
            made deliberate uses of the colors in the brand kit to create a consistent,
            visually appealing, yet accessible design. The colors in the eligibility
            flow come from the brand kit. For the portals, we added some colors
            to distinguish between the caregiver and caree portals, and their 
            different states.  
            
            Furthermore, we added dropdown menus responsible for changing the 
            language and font size if the user needs it. We also added a 
            'Read Aloud' button that would read elements on the page aloud
            for users who may need it.
            
            All buttons were set to follow the same style. Prior, some buttons were 
            more rounded than others. We decided to make all buttons the same shape
            to create a consistent design.
            
            In various frames of the design, we gave users the ability to skip 
            steps if they so choose. This is especially important for users who
            find themselves not having the information they need on hand.

            <h3>Summary of Elise's feedback</h3>
    
            <p class="inner-text">During our meeting with Elise, we received feedback and briefly went
              over our design process, high-fidelity wireframes, and the key decisions
              we made. Elise had 2 main points of feedback for us on the design: </p>
            
            <ol class="list-style-1">
              <li>To think of what the 'happy path' for the user would be, and ways in which we could nudge the user towards it. One example of a happy path that she gave us was nudging caregivers to link their accounts to that of an existing Uno member, despite the registration flow providing multiple other options for the caregiver.</li>
              <li>To think of ways for users to interact with the Uno process without having to download the app / be a member. </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Our final revisions (Extra Credit)</h3>
            
            <p class="inner-text">In response to Elise's first piece of feedback about Happy Paths, we changed the buttons on screens with multiple options to nudge users towards acting in a certain way. We updated our design so that the 'Happy Paths' are marked by buttons colored accent green (aka. dark green), and other possible paths that the user could take at that point are represented by buttons of a lighter color for a clearer visual difference. The use of accent green as a marker of the happy path is repeated throughout our design, so the user's association of accent green with the 'ideal' path to take is reinforced. We also changed the size of other buttons when appropriate for a clearer visual hierachy. Below is an example of one such screen design change we made, such that the happy path is clearly indicated through the use of color and button size. </p>

            <img class="part_7 image" src="images\revisions.jpg" alt="high fi revision: happy paths">

            <p class="inner-text">In response to her second piece of feedback, we included a way for the user to communicate with either their caree/caregiver over text message, such that their caree/caregiver would not necessarily need to have an Uno account to help them out. This text message will contain a link to a webpage where the caree/caregiver would be able to upload the documents without needing an Uno account. The message will also contain postal/fax information if the caree/caregiver of the user would prefer to use alternative methods to send Uno the information instead.</p>

          <p class="inner-text">
            Over the course of this project, we were able to transform a project
            brief on a real problem that Uno Health is facing into a high-fidelity 
            clickable prototype that offers a solution to the problem. 

            Stepping through the entire design process from end-to-end, we gained 
            first hand experience iterating on a design and incorporating actionable 
            feedback from our peers and startup partner. In a future design sprint,
            we'd like to keep building out our prototype to include animations that 
            guide users seamlessly through the flow. Further, we'd love to test 
            our prototype on end users to figure out where assumptions we made 
            may have fallen short.

            Finally, keeping the caregiver stakeholder at the top of our minds, 
            we'd imagine what the portal may look like after the point of application. 
            How might caregivers continue to provide help to their carees 
            throughout their time on Uno Health? Exploring this route would 
            allow us to continue realizing Uno's mission of lowering the barrier 
            of entry to Medicare benefits for all those who are eligible.
